Thumbs.db  # Windows thumbnail cache

# Example for specific large files or directories you don't want to track:
# large_data_folder/
# another_big_file.zip

# If you are using a specific package manager (e.g., Poetry, Conda):
.poetry/  # Poetry cache directory (if you don't commit the poetry.lock file)
.conda/  # Conda cache directory (if you don't commit the environment.yml file)

# Files related to the virtual environment
pyvenv.cfg  # Virtual environment configuration file

# Man pages (unlikely you need these in your repo)
share/man/man1/

# The confusing line - site-packages should *not* be in your repo
lib/python3.12/site-packages/ # This line is likely a mistake and should be REMOVED from your repo.  You should *not* version control site-packages.
